My approach was not TDD nor BDD, as I have no commercial experience with either.

CQRS pattern is one I'm also not familiar with, I primarily understand the Repository service layer pattern.  

I would like to have used this, and implement some DI for some testing later on.

As stated I have attempted to stick with the bare minimum required as this is just throw away code.

My Approach is that of my experience the last 3-4 years, TDD and BDD is my main weakness as i have no experience
As I've mentioned before.
